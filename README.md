# CDL School Employee Dashboard

## Description
---
This is the front end of a capstone project encapsulating all technologies learned and used while at NSS(Nashville Software School)

This is a single page web application utilizing React for the front end and Python-Django Rest for the backend. This app is an employee dashboard for employees at a CDL Academy/school. It is used for them to manage and view things such as paystubs, benefits, days off as well as contact information for companies that sponser the program. It uses Django User Auth for authentication, registering, and logging in. Once a user is logged in the app takes their id from local storage to retrieve their data for paystubs and benefits. This app also keeps track of equipment used by the school and contacts for recruiters for companies that sponser/support the program.
